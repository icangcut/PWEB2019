			<div> Jogja, known as city with the sweetest food. I love all Jogja's food, especially the traditional one, such as gado-gado, Lotek, and sate klathak. But the most famous one is Gudeg.
				Its popularity has reached all around the world. 
				Made from young jackfruit, its so good when eaten along with chicken eggs, chicken meat, and some friends to share with. You guys must try some! </div>
